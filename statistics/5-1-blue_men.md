[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

>> In order to join Blue Man Group, you have to be male between 5’10” and 6’1” What percentage of the U.S. male population is in this range? 

```
import brfss
import scipy
df = brfss.ReadBrfss()
```

I got 47.3% cuz i used the actual data from df...
They got 34% cuz they just used a normal distribution

##### MY WAY:

```
# 1 is men
# 2 is women

men = df[df.sex = 1]
avg = men.htm3.mean() # 178
sd = men.htm3.std() #7.7

def inches_to_cm(inches):
	return inches*2.54


# 5,10 = 12*5 +10 = 70 inches
# 6,1 = 12*6 + 1 = 73 inches

low = inches_to_cm(70) #177.8
high = inches_to_cm(73) # 185.4

num_men = len(men) # 155703
num_blue_men = len(men[(men.htm3 > 177.8) & (men.htm3 < 185.4)]) # 73697
num_blue_men/float(num_men) # 47%...


p_low = len(men[men.htm3<177.8])/float(num_men) #40%
p_high = len(men[men.htm3<185.4])/float(num_men) # 87%
p_high - p_low # 47%
```

##### THEIR WAY:

```
avg = 178
sd = 7.7

norm_dis = scipy.stats.norm(loc = avg, scale = sd)
plow = norm_dis.cdf(low) # 49%
phigh = norm_dis.cdf(high) # 83%
perc = phigh-plow # 34%
```

The Point of all this is that you can find the probability of people within a range by subtracting the high cdf from the low cdf.

This is mainly for continous random variables
