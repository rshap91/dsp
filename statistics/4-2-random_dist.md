>> Exercise 4.2 The numbers generated by are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

```
samp = np.random.random(1000)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(samp)
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(samp)

# they are
plt.figure()
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
plt.figure()
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
